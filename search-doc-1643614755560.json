However, the use of colour is being phased out as Roblox adopts the identity of a platform rather than the game it was considered previously, with colours being discouraged as it creates poor user experiences for those who are colourblind and associates it with a specific activity rather than the vast potential of the platform. As Explorer Kura is designed for the future, it is designed with the design cues of Explorer, using blacks, whites and greys to provide a simple panel with a clear hierachy. "},{"title":"Extensibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Explorer Kura?","url":"docs/whykura#extensibility","content":"It is currently difficult for developers to add additional functions to the modules. The modulisation and the non-standard installation practices whilst providing easy debug options and installation makes it difficult for the developer to know how to extend the capabilities of the module. Explorer Kura resolves this by allowing developers extensiblity through Quick Action Modules. These allow integration between the educator and the experience. For example, the educator could instantly reset the place in a physics experience or demonstrate safety procedures by spawning dangers in a chemistry lab.
