Explorer Kura is a module to allow educators to provide the best possible education experience to their students by providing a easy to use interface with actions that can be customised by the developer to suit the educator.

This module is designed as a replacement for Roblox's Classroom Mode. Whilst the two can functionally coexist, why would you run two modules that have the same purpose at the same time?
