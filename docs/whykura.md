# Why Explorer Kura?

In November 2021, Roblox introduced Classroom Mode. Whilst some praised the existence of this additional feature, others critiqued many aspects of the module, involving the design of the user interface, the lack of extensibility and the licensing of the module.

Explorer Kura aims to resolve all of these concerns.

## Better User Interface

The current Classroom Mode user interface evokes of the "2016 Roblox", when colour was still prominent on Roblox. However, the use of colour is being phased out as Roblox adopts the identity of a platform with colours being discouraged as it creates poor user experiences for those who are colourblind.

As Explorer Kura is designed for the future, it is designed with the design cues of Explorer, using blacks, whites and greys to provide a simple panel with a clear hierachy.

## Extensibility

It is currently difficult for developers to add additional functions to the modules. The modulisation and the non-standard installation practices whilst providing easy debug options and installation makes it difficult for the developer to know how to extend the capabilities of the module.

Explorer Kura resolves this by allowing developers extensiblity through Quick Action Modules. These allow integration between the educator and the experience. For example, the educator could instantly reset the place in a physics experience or demonstrate safety procedures by spawning dangers in a chemistry lab.

## Apache-2.0 Licensing

Explorer Kura utilises Apache-2.0 licensing to allow developers to customise their installation of Kura. Kura also uses various third-party dependencies to create Kura as well as extend the possibilities of developers trying their hand at something different.

## The future of Kura

Explorer will be released in H2 2022. When this happens, Explorer Kura will then be able to link to Explorer to allow educators to create Education Group Joins with privacy settings, allowing educators to access a curated list of experiences with management permissions in these experiences to avoid undesirable behaviour, no additional sign-ups required.
